# Project deliverables

## Interim Presentation Requirements

1. The presentation shall inform the viewer how the system design of the project has been approached
   1. There shall be a breakdown of subsystems
2. The presentation shall show how subsystems are integrated
   1. There shall be evidence of the implementation of software communication protocols between subsystems, using dummy data where functionality has not yet been implemented
   2. Where applicable to the project, there shall be specifications of digital and analogue data interfaces between subsystems, including voltage ranges, bandwidths/bitrates and microcontroller requirements (GPIO, SPI, UART, ADC etc.). There should be evidence of testing these interfaces
   3. Where applicable to the project, there shall be specifications of power supply interfaces between subsystems, including voltage and current ranges, power requirements and energy storage technologies.

## Report Requirements
